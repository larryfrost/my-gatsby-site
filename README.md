## My Gatby Site
This is a Gatby site I created using Docker,Gatsby and Node.js. The site is a blog site with three post about a pet rock, the site also pulls data from a recipe website and returns with the specified sections for each article and recipe.

**Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/larryfrost/my-gatsby-site.git
   ```
## What the site does
- Pulls content from the recipe and article sections of a website using GraphQL
- Makes sure that Docker is running on the website
- Creates blog posts using .mdx
- Uses Seo to help format the title of each page
- Performs tests to make sure everything is functioning properly.
